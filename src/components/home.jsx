                    <p>IT postgraduate student achieving a distinction in MSc Applied Computing and Information Technology from the University of Bedfordshire.
                        Being the Senior Network Administrator at Aldwickbury School has enabled me to become a confident and strong communicator with the ability to manage multiple tasks efficiently and responsibly, as well as work with the team to achieve a certain objective on time with excellence. I believe that such experience, together with the analytical, evaluative and troubleshooting skills honed during my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, will make me the best fit for your team. Finally, working alongside your team will give me the ability to apply my IT skills and knowledge to support the fast progression of your organisationâ€™s infrastructure.
